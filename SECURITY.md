## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you notice a program that contains malicious logic, a security flaw (like a buffer overflow in a C program), or accidentally exposed sensitive data:

1. **Do not** open a public issue.
2. Email me at: **dibbispersonal@gmail.com** (as listed on my profile).
3. I will review the code and remove or patch the vulnerability within 48-72 hours.

## Policy on "Malware" Samples
This repository is for educational programs only. Any contribution containing code designed to harm a system (ransomware, spyware, etc.) will be rejected and reported.
