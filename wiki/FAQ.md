2. Use the interactive `index.html` status page
3. Navigate directly to `language/0000_filename.ext`

### What do the filename numbers mean?

The numbers correspond to problem numbers in `questions.md`:
- `0001` = Problem #1
- `0042` = Problem #42
- `0089` = Problem #89

### What do the status symbols mean?

- ✅ **Done**: Fully implemented and tested
- ❗️ **Beta/WIP**: Functional but may have issues
- ❌ **Missing**: Not yet implemented

### Can I run these programs?

Yes! Each program is a standalone solution. See the [Getting Started Guide](Getting-Started) for language-specific instructions.

### Why are some problems missing in certain languages?

We're continuously adding solutions. Missing implementations are opportunities for contribution!

## Contributing

### How can I contribute?

Several ways:
1. Add missing solutions
2. Implement problems in new languages
3. Fix bugs or improve existing code
4. Add new problem suggestions
5. Improve documentation

See the [Contributing Guide](Contributing) for details.

### Do I need permission to contribute?

No! Just:
1. Fork the repository
2. Make your changes
3. Submit a pull request
4. Follow the contribution guidelines

### What languages can I contribute in?

Any programming language! We currently support 17+, but we welcome new languages. See [Adding a New Language](Adding-New-Language).

### What should I do before submitting a PR?

1. Read [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/DibyajyotiBiswal57/programs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Follow the naming convention: `0000_filename.ext`
3. Test your code thoroughly
4. Place files in the correct language folder
5. Fill out the PR template completely

### My PR was rejected. Why?

Common reasons:
- Doesn't follow naming convention
- Code has syntax errors
- Missing test validation
- Placed in wrong folder
- Duplicate solution already exists
- Security vulnerabilities

Check reviewer comments for specific feedback.

## Technical Questions

### What's the naming convention?

Format: `0000_filename.ext`
- 4-digit problem number
- Descriptive filename (matches questions.md)
- Appropriate file extension

Examples:
- `0001_hello_world.py`
- `0042_palindrome_string.java`
- `0089_first_character_check.c`

### Can I use external libraries?

Prefer standard library solutions when possible. If external libraries are necessary:
- Document them clearly
- Provide installation instructions
- Justify why they're needed

### Should I include input/output examples?

Yes! Include as comments:
- Problem description
- Input format
- Expected output
- Edge cases (if applicable)

### How do I handle user input?

Follow language conventions:
- **Python**: `input()`
- **Java**: `Scanner` class
- **C**: `scanf()`
- **C++**: `cin`

See language-specific guides for details.

### What about error handling?

Good practice but not required for simple problems. For complex problems:
- Validate input
- Handle edge cases
- Provide meaningful error messages

## Problem-Specific Questions

### Where can I find problem statements?

In `questions.md` - organized by difficulty level:
- Beginner (1-20)
- Intermediate (21-50)
- Advanced (51-89)

### Can I suggest new problems?

Yes! Use the [New Problem template](https://github.com/DibyajyotiBiswal57/programs/issues/new?template=new_problem.md).

Include:
- Clear problem statement
- Input/output examples
- Test cases
- Difficulty level
- Category

### Are there test cases for problems?

Some problems include test cases in comments. For comprehensive testing:
- Create your own test cases
- Test edge cases
- Verify against the problem description

### Can I solve problems differently than the existing solutions?

Absolutely! Multiple approaches are encouraged:
- Different algorithms
- Optimized versions
- Alternative implementations

Document why your approach is different/better.

## Status Page & Automation

### How does the status page work?

The `index.html` is automatically generated by `generate_html.py`:
- Reads from `questions.md` and `status.md`
- Creates interactive table
- Updates status badges
- Adds dark mode support

### How are statuses determined?

By `update_status.py`:
- Files with 'beta' or 'wip' → Beta status (❗️)
- Files with 'unfinished' or 'todo' → Missing (❌)
- All others → Done (✅)

### Can I run the automation scripts locally?

Yes!
```bash
# Update status
python3 update_status.py

# Generate HTML
python3 generate_html.py
```

See [Automation Guide](Automation) for details.

### Why is my new solution not showing on the status page?

The status page updates automatically via GitHub Actions. If not showing:
1. Check filename follows convention
2. Ensure file is in correct folder
3. Wait for automated workflow to run
4. Check if workflows are passing

## Language-Specific Questions

### Which language should I learn first?

Recommended for beginners:
1. **Python** - Easy syntax, versatile
2. **Java** - Strong typing, widely used
3. **C** - Understanding fundamentals

See individual [Language Guides](Language-Guides) for more info.

### Can I compare solutions across languages?

Yes! That's a key feature. Look at the same problem number across different language folders.

### Which language has the most solutions?

Check the status page or run:
```bash
ls python/ | wc -l
ls java/ | wc -l
# etc.
```

### Are some languages better for certain problems?

Yes! For example:
- **String manipulation**: Python, Perl, Ruby
- **Mathematical**: Python, Julia, Mathematica
- **Performance**: C, C++, Rust
- **System scripting**: Bash, PowerShell, Batch

## Troubleshooting

### I found a bug in a solution. What should I do?

1. Verify it's actually a bug
2. Check if it's already reported
3. [Open a bug report](https://github.com/DibyajyotiBiswal57/programs/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
4. Or submit a fix via PR!

### The code doesn't run on my system. Why?

Common reasons:
- Wrong compiler/interpreter version
- Missing dependencies
- Path issues
- OS-specific code

See [Troubleshooting Guide](Troubleshooting) for solutions.
