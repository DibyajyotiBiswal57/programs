## 🏷️ File Naming Convention: `0000_filename`

To keep our collection organized and sorted logically, please follow this strict naming format for all new files:

**Format:** `[4-Digit Index]_[short-description].[extension]`

### Rules:
1. **The Prefix:** Always use four digits. If your number is less than 1000, use **leading zeros** (e.g., `0001`, `0042`, `0150`).
2. **The Separator:** Use a single **underscore** (`_`) between the number and the name.
3. **The Description:** Use `kebab-case` (all lowercase, hyphens instead of spaces) for the descriptive part.
4. **No Spaces:** Never use spaces in the filename.

### Examples:
* ✅ `0001_hello-world.py`
* ✅ `0012_binary-search-tree.java`
* ✅ `0105_bubble-sort-optimization.cpp`
* ❌ `1_helloworld.py` (Missing leading zeros)
* ❌ `0002 filename.java` (Contains a space)
